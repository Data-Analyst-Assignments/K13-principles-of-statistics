# K13 Principles of Statistics

# Assignment Brief: K13 – Principles of Statistics for Analysing Datasets

## Title  
**Applying Statistical Techniques to Business Data**

---

## Aim  
To demonstrate competence in applying core statistical techniques to real-world datasets. This task will assess your understanding of statistical principles and your ability to interpret numerical results in a business context.

---

## Learning Outcome – K13  
**Understand and apply key statistical methods used for analysing datasets.**

You must explain and apply at least five of the following techniques:

- Mean  
- Median  
- Mode  
- Range  
- Standard Deviation  
- Variance  
- Linear Regression

---

## Task Overview  
You have been provided with a dataset that reflects typical business activity (e.g., product sales, customer feedback, regional performance). Your objective is to conduct statistical analysis and provide a structured report covering:

1. The statistical methods applied  
2. How each method was used  
3. Results and findings  
4. Interpretation of insights in a business context

---

## Report Structure

| Section | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **1. Introduction** | Provide a short overview of the dataset and define the purpose of your analysis. |
| **2. Statistical Techniques** | Use separate subheadings for each technique (e.g., *2.1 Mean*). Explain the method, apply it to the dataset, and present the output with supporting visuals (tables, charts where appropriate). |
| **3. Business Interpretation** | Explain what the results indicate about trends, behaviours, or outcomes. Relate the insights to business scenarios such as performance evaluation, forecasting, or resource planning. |
| **4. Conclusion** | Summarise the key findings and reflect on how statistics support data-driven decision-making. |
